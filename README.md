# Key Takeaways:

    Transfer learning, as we have seen so far, is having the ability to utilize existing knowledge from the source learner in the target task. During the process of transfer learning, the following three important questions must be answered:

* What to transfer: This is the first and the most important step in the whole process. We try to seek answers about which part of the knowledge can be transferred from the source to the target in order to improve the performance of the target task. When trying to answer this question, we try to identify which portion of knowledge is source-specific and what is common between the source and the target.

* When to transfer: There can be scenarios where transferring knowledge for the sake of it may make matters worse than improving anything (also known as negative transfer). We should aim at utilizing transfer learning to improve target task performance/results and not degrade them. We need to be careful about when to transfer and when not to.

* How to transfer: Once the what and when have been answered, we can proceed towards identifying ways of actually transferring the knowledge across domains/tasks. This involves changes to existing algorithms and different techniques, which we will cover in later sections of this article. Also, specific case studies are lined up in the end for a better understanding of how to transfer.

      This should help us define the various scenarios where transfer learning can be applied and possible techniques, which we will discuss in the next section.
